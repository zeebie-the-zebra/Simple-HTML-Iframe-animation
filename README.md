# Simple-HTML-Iframe-animation

This HTML document creates a webpage that functions as an animation engine using iframes to display HTML frames stored in the frames/ directory. 
I used this for animating the HTML pages generated by TextImageConverter (https://github.com/zeebie-the-zebra/TextImageConverter)

However while this is working; I have adbandoned this approach and simply converted the HTML back into PNG and then into an MP4. using HTML-to_PNG (https://github.com/zeebie-the-zebra/HTML-to-PNG) and FFMPEG (https://github.com/zeebie-the-zebra/FFMPEG-Frame-Extraction-and-Recomplier)

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

HTML Structure:

* Sets up basic HTML structure with necessary meta tags and styles.
* Includes a header and a loader section where iframes will be dynamically loaded.
* Contains an audio element (#bgAudio) for background music.

CSS:

* Defines styles for the body, header, loader, iframes, and footer to ensure the animation displays correctly.

JavaScript (Script Block):

* Variable Initialization: Defines variables such as currentIndex, totalFrames, pages, targetFrameRate, and frameInterval.
* Page URL Generation: Generates URLs (pages array) for all frames using a loop.
* Function to Preload and Cache Frames: `
preloadAndCachePages(startIndex, endIndex)asynchronously preloads and caches HTML frames usingfetchandcaches.open`.

* Function to Initialize Audio: initializeAudio() sets up and plays background audio.
* Animation Loop: loadNextPage(timestamp) manages the animation loop using requestAnimationFrame, loading frames into iframes (#frame1 and #frame2) and swapping between them for smooth transitions.
* Resize Handling: resizeIframe() adjusts iframe dimensions based on window size and updates on window resize.
* Preloading Frames: Divides frames into chunks and preloads them using preloadAndCachePages, ensuring smooth playback by reducing load times.
* Initialization: After all frames are preloaded (Promise.all(chunkPromises)), initializes audio and starts the animation loop.

Event Listeners:

* Listens for iframe load events to log when frames are loaded.
* Listens for user interaction (clicks and keydowns) to initialize audio playback.

Footer:

* Provides additional information about the purpose of the animation engine and notes regarding browser compatibility issues.

Purpose: The webpage serves as an animation engine that loads and displays a series of HTML frames as an animation sequence, synchronized with background audio. It uses iframes and preloading techniques to ensure smooth playback of the frames.
